# Procedure to run the files :

Follow the steps given below :
	1).. Open Terminal
	2).. change directory to this program dir
	3).. type below command to run
		python3 FILENAME.py
	4).. *choose any word form files to find its stem*
	5).. Enter the word in Exicuting program when asked
	6).. Take Output



## for program files : 
	test_from_dictionary.py and 
	test_from_stemfile.py

	the output genrated may not be accurate but if will generate most possible stem
	Main word as short as possible

## for program files :
	test_from_d_list.py and 
	test_from_sf_list.py
	
	The output generated is a list of all the possible stems which can be generated by removing all the possible stems
	Llist of all the possible mainwords generated by removing the all the possible stemwords



This is temperary rule based stemmer
It may give wrong output as of now


for better accuracy and convinience we must have Machine Learnig Model


### For Supervised Machine Learning
Machine lerning model is under construction but due to some shortage of Pure data it is limited for only few stems words

### For Unsupervised Machine Learning
Classifiers as good but wont give exact answer
As in it will also generate most probable stemWord
